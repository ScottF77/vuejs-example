# vuejs-example
This is a basic example of a VueJS application
It is built from the VueJS CLI

The application has two views, components that talk to the parent views and dumb components that simply emit events to the parent

It has a Vuex store set up

It has a simple call to an API using Axios (https://github.com/imcvampire/vue-axios)

TODO - Make this into an actual app rather than the CLI example
